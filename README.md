# Hello there! 👋

I'm Joaquín, a High School student doing the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) CS Curriculum.

## About Me

I'm passionate about anything I try to do. I was given an Arduino as a gift when I was just 7 years old, and that's how I got started with learning about electronics and programming. I'm now trying to get a more formal approach to what I've learned.

## My Education

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I studied Math with Khan Academy. This helped incredibly with my High School classes later on.

I'm currently studying Computer Science through the [OSSU Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

## My Skills

Here are some of the technologies I'm proficient in:

- Java & Kotlin
- Arduino
- Rust

And some of the technologies I liked working with:
- Python
- PHP
- Node.js
- [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
